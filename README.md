# Donut Mayhem

An iOS app written in Swift, based on a simple premise: basting donuts. Play as a muffin while you shoot bombs to
destroy donuts and get points. Then, cash in your hard-earned coins for new types of muffins to play as and donuts to
fight against.

Idea and programming by [@skunkmb][skunkmb] and graphic design done by [@Lee20][lee20].
